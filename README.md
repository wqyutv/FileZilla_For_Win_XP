This version of FileZilla 3.8.0 Win32 works on Windows XP

After looking online and trying a lot of downloads almost all of them yield to a 404 file not found or the site simply does not have them, but I did find a copy from the Wayback Machine that works on Windows XP and it seems to be the last version to work. 

You can download the copy from the Wayback Machine or download it from this archive http://web.archive.org/web/20140603125717/http://softlayer-dal.dl.sourceforge.net/project/filezilla/FileZilla_Client/3.8.0/FileZilla_3.8.0_win32-setup.exe
